      Hi, I have created two roles, admin and user, admin users can add and delete tasks, I created a project where the user can only see the tasks added to it
      With spring security, I developed a project where the user can log in and after logging in, a jwt token belonging to the user is generated and only logged in and authorized users can take action.
